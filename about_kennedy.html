        <h1>Hi, I'm Alex, but Kennedy is my middle name.</h1>
	    <h2>She/Her</h2>
		<h3>My middle name originated from my great-grandmothers family, Kennedy being her maiden name. I have always loved the name and I often include it when I write my signature.</h3>

		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I love the arts, particularly sculpture and dance. I thoroughly enjoy live music, probably because I'm not-so musically inclined, but that's never stopped me from dancing. These days, I prefer to stay in as opposed to going out -- even though we haven't been able to really choose lately -- and have moved to the country away from city life. When I lived in the city it seemed like life never slowed down, which was very exciting, but not as exhiliarating to me as nature.
		</p>
		<p>I love to get my hands dirty in the garden, growing my own food is like a form of therapy. When you get to cook and bake with your crop, that takes the cake! I love being in the kitchen, so I find the two work well together.
		</p>
