        <h1>Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
	    <h2>She/Her</h2>
		<h3>I'm often misconstrued as a guy on paper. This has brought on many funny real-life introductions.</h3>

	    <h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm an avid tea-drinker, but I also enjoy the occasional coffee -- with oat milk! I used to despise coffee, but after working as a Barista for 6 years, it grew on me. I used to live in Toronto and it brought me closer to people from all walks of life, and gave me a greater understanding of culture as well as a great appreciation for those who celebrate it.
		</p>
		<p>I'm the oldest of my generation in my family. I've found that's put a lot of extra responsibility on my shoulders, but that also meant that I got to make a lot of the decisions growing up, and even now. I believe being the oldest also lead to my interest in video games, console and desktop, not having an older sibling to hog them all of the time really helped, too.
